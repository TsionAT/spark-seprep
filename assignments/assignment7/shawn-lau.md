#### What went well

The Chatbot ran properly and didn't take too long to boot up or process my input. In addition, the responses were quite insightful.

#### What didn't go well

Initially installing the model was quite troublesome as the first installation failed. Furthermore, after a while, one of the scripts failed and chatbot stopped working.
