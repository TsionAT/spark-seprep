### I ran the Chatbot

Here is my Chatbot Screenshot

#### What went well

I liked how the chatbot matched my lingo. When I started the conversation with 'Yo' it responded by starting its sentenced with 'Yo'. That is unfortunately about all that went well.

#### What didn't go well

First, when I asked what the weather is going to be like tomorrow, it made up an answer. I know that it did because I asked it what day it is and it said it doesn't know realtime information. Next, I asked it what 365 * 44 is and it said 1580 which is completely wrong. When I told it it was wrong, it kept doubling down saying it was correct. Then I gave it the correct answer, it thanked me, and then when I asked again it got it wrong again saying it was 1580. Overall, this chatbot is definetly not reliable at all.
